# 🔐 Tachi Protocol - Hardware Wallet Integration Guide

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This guide implements **MANDATORY** hardware wallet integration for all production operations in the Tachi Protocol. Following the principle of defense-in-depth, this eliminates the single-point-of-failure risk identified in the operational security assessment.

## 🚨 Critical Security Requirements

### ✅ MANDATORY for Production:
- **Hardware Wallets Only**: All 5 production signers MUST use hardware wallets
- **Multi-Signature**: 3-of-5 signature scheme for all administrative operations
- **Secure Storage**: Recovery phrases stored in fireproof safes or bank vaults
- **Regular Audits**: Monthly security reviews and key rotation procedures

### ❌ PROHIBITED for Production:
- Single EOA ownership (current vulnerability)
- Browser wallet extensions (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)
- Software wallets on computers
- Plaintext private key storage
- Shared or personal computing devices

---

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Hardware Wallet Procurement ⏱️ Week 1

#### Required Hardware (Per Signer):
```
Primary Device:
- Ledger Nano X (preferred) or Trezor Model T
- USB-C cable (included)
- Recovery phrase storage (metal backup)

Backup Device:
- Secondary hardware wallet (same model)
- Stored in different physical location
```

#### Security Accessories:
```
- Cryptosteel Capsule (metal recovery phrase backup)
- Fireproof safe or bank safety deposit box
- Tamper-evident bags for storage
- Dedicated air-gapped computer (optional but recommended)
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Signature Deployment ⏱️ Week 2

#### 2.1 Deploy Multi-Signature Infrastructure

```bash
# Deploy multi-sig factory and wallet
cd /Users/justin/Tachi/tachi/packages/contracts
npm run deploy:multisig -- --network baseSepolia

# Expected output:
# ✅ TachiMultiSigFactory deployed to: 0x...
# ✅ Multi-Signature Wallet deployed to: 0x...
# ✅ CrawlNFTMultiSig deployed to: 0x...
```

#### 2.2 Hardware Wallet Address Generation

```bash
# Generate addresses using standard derivation path
# Derivation Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0

# Signer 1 (CEO/Founder)
Hardware Wallet 1: 0x742E1F1F1A7bf939e5e3EdC0A8E3f3A2f8Ce53D1

# Signer 2 (CTO)
Hardware Wallet 2: 0x8fE05De9a6b2f5e14a7b1E55cDc4e8C4B79A88f6

# Signer 3 (Security Officer)
Hardware Wallet 3: 0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC

# Signer 4 (Operations Lead)
Hardware Wallet 4: 0xF4a2Fc0A06E6f22c88f7E4A2d9b8a8E4A2f8Ce53

# Signer 5 (External Advisor)
Hardware Wallet 5: 0x2C6E97D8F4a2Fc0A06E6f22c88f7E4A2d9b8a8E4
```

### Phase 3: Ownership Transfer ⏱️ Week 2-3

#### 3.1 Current Contract Ownership Status
```solidity
// CRITICAL VULNERABILITY - Single EOA ownership
CrawlNFT.owner(): 0xdDa104A3EcA774039aE2800f53dAbA4da8C8306d
PaymentProcessor.owner(): 0xdDa104A3EcA774039aE2800f53dAbA4da8C8306d
ProofOfCrawlLedger.owner(): 0xdDa104A3EcA774039aE2800f53dAbA4da8C8306d
```

#### 3.2 Safe Ownership Transfer Process
```bash
# Step 1: Deploy multi-sig wallet with hardware wallet signers
npm run deploy:multisig

# Step 2: Transfer ownership to multi-sig (IRREVERSIBLE)
npm run transfer-ownership -- --multisig 0x[MULTISIG_ADDRESS]

# Step 3: Verify ownership transfer
npm run verify-ownership
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Multi-Signature Wallet Configuration

```solidity
// Production Configuration (3-of-5)
TachiMultiSig {
    REQUIRED_SIGNATURES: 3,
    MAX_SIGNERS: 5,
    TIMELOCK_DELAY: 24 hours, // For critical operations
    signers: [
        0x742E1F1F1A7bf939e5e3EdC0A8E3f3A2f8Ce53D1, // Hardware Wallet 1
        0x8fE05De9a6b2f5e14a7b1E55cDc4e8C4B79A88f6, // Hardware Wallet 2
        0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC, // Hardware Wallet 3
        0xF4a2Fc0A06E6f22c88f7E4A2d9b8a8E4A2f8Ce53, // Hardware Wallet 4
        0x2C6E97D8F4a2Fc0A06E6f22c88f7E4A2d9b8a8E4  // Hardware Wallet 5
    ]
}
```

### Smart Contract Integration

```solidity
// Updated contract ownership model
contract CrawlNFTMultiSig {
    address public multiSigWallet; // Multi-sig address
    
    modifier onlyMultiSig() {
        require(msg.sender == multiSigWallet, "Only multi-sig");
        _;
    }
    
    // All admin functions use onlyMultiSig instead of onlyOwner
    function mintLicense(address publisher, string calldata termsURI) 
        external onlyMultiSig returns (uint256) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## 🔒 Operational Procedures

### Transaction Signing Workflow

#### 1. Transaction Initiation
```bash
# Any signer can submit a transaction
multisig.submitTransaction(
    target: 0x[CONTRACT_ADDRESS],
    value: 0,
    data: encodedFunctionCall
);
```

#### 2. Multi-Signature Approval Process
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Signer 1      │    │   Signer 2      │    │   Signer 3      │
│   Submits TX    │───▶│   Reviews & Signs │───▶│   Reviews & Signs │
│   Auto-confirms │    │   Confirms TX   │    │   Executes TX   │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘

Minimum 3 signatures required for execution
```

#### 3. Hardware Wallet Signing
```
1. 🔌 Connect hardware wallet to secure computer
2. 🔍 Review transaction details on device screen
3. ✅ Verify target contract and function call
4. 🖋️  Sign transaction on hardware device
5. 📤 Submit signature to multi-sig contract
6. 🔌 Disconnect hardware wallet
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency Pause Protocol
```solidity
// Guardian role can emergency pause
function setEmergencyPause(bool paused) external onlyRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE);
```

#### Key Compromise Response
```
1. 🚨 IMMEDIATE: Notify all other signers
2. 🔒 IMMEDIATE: Trigger emergency pause if possible
3. 📞 IMMEDIATE: Contact security team
4. 🔄 24 HOURS: Initiate signer replacement process
5. 🔍 72 HOURS: Complete security audit
```
