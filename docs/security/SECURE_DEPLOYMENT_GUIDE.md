## üéØ Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Security Setup

### 1.1 Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy production environment template
cp .env.production.template .env.production

# Generate secure CSRF secret
node -e "console.log('CSRF_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Add the generated secret to .env.production
```

### 1.2 Required Environment Variables

**Critical Security Settings:**
```bash
# Security
CSRF_SECRET=your_generated_32_character_hex_string
ENABLE_SECURITY_LOGGING=true
SECURITY_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-monitoring-service.com/webhooks/security

# Production Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=8453
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL=https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY

# Contract Addresses (Update with your deployed contracts)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CRAWLNFT_ADDRESS=0x_your_production_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENTPROCESSOR_ADDRESS=0x_your_production_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROOF_LEDGER_ADDRESS=0x_your_production_address
```

### 1.3 Cloudflare Worker Configuration

**Required Secrets (set via `wrangler secret put`):**
```bash

## üéØ Phase 2: Security Validation Testing

### 2.1 Pre-Deployment Security Tests

```bash
# 1. Validate environment configuration
npm run validate-env

# 2. Run security linting
npm run lint:security

# 3. Test CSRF protection
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/publishers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}' \
  # Should return 403 CSRF error

# 4. Test rate limiting
for i in {1..101}; do
  curl -s http://localhost:3003/ > /dev/null
done
# Should start returning 429 after 100 requests

# 5. Test input validation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/publishers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-CSRF-Token: valid_token" \
  -d '{"domain": "<script>alert(1)</script>"}' \
  # Should return 400 validation error
```

### 2.2 Security Header Verification

```bash
# Check security headers are present
curl -I https://your-domain.com | grep -E "(Content-Security-Policy|X-Frame-Options|Strict-Transport-Security)"

# Expected output:
# Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'...
# X-Frame-Options: DENY
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

## üéØ Phase 3: Production Deployment

### 3.1 Next.js Dashboard Deployment

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build for production
npm run build

# 3. Deploy to Vercel/your platform
vercel --prod

# 4. Verify deployment
curl -I https://dashboard.tachi.app
```

### 3.2 Cloudflare Worker Deployment

```bash
# 1. Build and deploy worker
wrangler deploy --env production

# 2. Verify worker is accessible
curl https://your-worker.domain.com/tachi-terms

# 3. Test AI crawler detection
curl -H "User-Agent: GPTBot/1.0" https://your-worker.domain.com/
# Should return 402 Payment Required
```

### 3.3 DNS and SSL Configuration

```bash
# 1. Configure DNS records
# A record: dashboard.tachi.app -> your-server-ip
# CNAME: worker.tachi.app -> your-worker.domain.workers.dev

# 2. Enable Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud)
# 3. Configure SSL/TLS to "Full (strict)"
# 4. Enable HSTS in Cloudflare dashboard
