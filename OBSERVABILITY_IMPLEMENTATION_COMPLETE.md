  - ✅ `/api/health/blockchain` - RPC connectivity and blockchain state
  
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Automated worker heartbeats to Better Uptime
- **Alert Configuration**: Multi-channel notification system

### 4. 🔧 Automated Setup & Configuration
- **Setup Script**: `setup-observability.sh` - Fully automated deployment
- **Verification Script**: `verify-observability.sh` - Implementation validation
- **Environment Template**: `.env.monitoring.template` - Complete configuration guide
- **Deployment Checklist**: `MONITORING_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step verification

## 📊 Monitoring Capabilities

### Real-Time Dashboards
1. **Sentry Performance Dashboard**
   - Application performance metrics
   - Error rate trends and patterns
   - User session replays for debugging
   - Transaction traces and bottleneck identification

2. **Better Uptime Status Page**
   - Service availability metrics (99.9% uptime target)
   - Response time monitoring (<2s target)
   - Incident tracking and resolution times
   - Public status page for transparency

3. **Tenderly Contract Monitoring**
   - Gas usage analysis and optimization insights
   - Transaction success rates (>98% target)
   - Contract state changes and event monitoring
   - Administrative function audit trail

### Alert System
```
🔔 Critical Alerts (Immediate Response Required)
├── Payment processing failures (>2% error rate)
├── Contract deployment/upgrade failures
├── Service downtime (>30 seconds)
└── Security incidents

⚠️  Warning Alerts (Investigation Required)
├── Performance degradation (>2s response time)
├── High error rates (>5% application errors)
├── Gas price spikes (>50% above normal)
└── Database query slowdowns (>1s average)

📊 Info Alerts (Monitoring)
├── Usage pattern changes
├── New user onboarding metrics
└── Resource utilization trends
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Features

- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Sentry configured to exclude wallet addresses, private keys, and transaction details
- **API Key Security**: All monitoring credentials stored in environment variables
- **Rate Limited Health Checks**: Prevents monitoring endpoint abuse
- **Error Context Sanitization**: Removes sensitive information before logging

   # Update with real API keys and DSNs
   ```

3. **Deploy with Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy dashboard with health endpoints
   npm run build && npm run start
   
   # Deploy worker with Sentry integration
   wrangler deploy
   ```

4. **Verify Implementation**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify-observability.sh
   ```

5. **Test Alert Flows**:
