# Tachi Protocol - Production Readiness Implementation Plan

## üéØ **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Hardening (1-2 Weeks)**

### 1. Deploy Production Subgraph ‚è±Ô∏è Days 1-3

**Current State:** Mock data in dashboard  
**Target:** Real-time on-chain data via The Graph

**Implementation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Finalize subgraph schema
cd subgraph/
graph init --from-contract 0x[CrawlNFT_ADDRESS] --network base-sepolia

# 2. Deploy to The Graph
graph auth --product hosted-service [ACCESS_TOKEN]
graph deploy --product hosted-service [USERNAME]/tachi-protocol

# 3. Update dashboard to consume subgraph
# Replace all mock data with GraphQL queries
```

**Files to Update:**
- `subgraph/schema.graphql` - Define Payment, CrawlLogged, Publisher entities
- `dashboard/lib/graphql/` - GraphQL queries and Apollo client setup
- `dashboard/hooks/useSubgraph.ts` - Custom hooks for real-time data

---

### 2. Implement Upgradeable Contracts ‚è±Ô∏è Days 2-4

**Current State:** Non-upgradeable contracts  
**Target:** UUPS proxy pattern with multi-sig governance

**Implementation Steps:**
```solidity
// 1. Convert to UUPS pattern
contract PaymentProcessorV1 is 
    Initializable, 
    UUPSUpgradeable, 
    OwnableUpgradeable {
    
    function initialize(address _usdcToken) public initializer {
        __Ownable_init();
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        usdcToken = _usdcToken;
    }
    
    function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) 
        internal 
        override 
        onlyOwner 
    {}
}
```

**Files to Create:**
- `contracts/PaymentProcessorV1.sol` - Upgradeable payment processor
- `contracts/CrawlNFTV1.sol` - Upgradeable NFT contract
- `scripts/deploy-proxy.ts` - Deployment with OpenZeppelin proxies
- `scripts/upgrade-contracts.ts` - Safe upgrade procedures

---

### 3. Secure Contract Ownership ‚è±Ô∏è Days 3-5

**Current State:** EOA ownership  
**Target:** Gnosis Safe multi-sig ownership

**Implementation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Deploy Gnosis Safe
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multisig.ts --network base-sepolia

# 2. Transfer ownership
npx hardhat run scripts/transfer-ownership.ts --network base-sepolia

# 3. Verify ownership transfer
npx hardhat run scripts/verify-ownership.ts --network base-sepolia
```

**Multi-sig Configuration:**
- **Signers:** 3 team members
- **Threshold:** 2 of 3 signatures required
- **Emergency contacts:** Pre-approved for time-sensitive operations

---

### 4. Set Up Environments ‚è±Ô∏è Days 4-6

```

**Environment Variables by Stage:**

**Vercel Dashboard:**
```bash
# Development
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBGRAPH_URL=https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/[dev-subgraph]

# Staging  
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBGRAPH_URL=https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/[staging-subgraph]

# Production
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=8453
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBGRAPH_URL=https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/[prod-subgraph]
```

**Cloudflare Worker:**
```bash
# wrangler.toml environments
[env.development]
name = "tachi-gateway-dev"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[env.staging] 
name = "tachi-gateway-staging"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[env.production]
name = "tachi-gateway-prod"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"
```
