## Estimated Timeline: 3-4 months for full production MVP

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Set up backend API server**
2. **Deploy contracts to testnet (Base Sepolia)**
3. **Create simple content serving endpoint**
4. **Build basic payment verification**

## Revenue Model Validation

For real adoption, you need:
- Pricing that makes sense for both sides ($0.001-$0.01 per request)
- Value proposition that beats existing solutions
- Easy integration for both publishers and crawlers
- Clear legal framework and terms

Would you like me to start building any of these components? I'd recommend starting with the backend API server and contract deployment to testnet as the foundation.
